# GUI for Google Cloud Plateform Emulators

## Description

This application provides a basic UI for interacting with [Google Cloud Platformâ„¢ Emulators](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/emulators).

This application is **not an official** Google application.

The application is under development and doesn't cover all emulator product APIs. I started this project to test Tauri App V2, then thought it would be intersting to provide something more functional. As an exploration project, I didn't cover features by tests.

As **Open source project**, feel free to participate, contribute, fork, etc. :
